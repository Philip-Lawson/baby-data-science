A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .	
This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .	
Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .	
A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .	
Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .	
A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .	
Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .	
The Importance of Being Earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations	
But it does n't leave you with much .	
You could hate it for the same reason .
